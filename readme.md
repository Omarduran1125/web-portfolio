# Omar D – Web Portfolio

## About This Project
This portfolio website was made as part of my Web Design calsswork.  
It includes three main pages—Home, Projects, and Contact—to show my understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, and responsive design.  
All pages follow accessibility and usability frendly user practices, and the site is fully deployed through GitHub Pages.

## What I Learned
- How to create a full funactinal webpage, organized HTML documents.  
- How to style and position elements using Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.  
- How to build a mobile/desktop responsive website and publish it on GitHub Pages.  
- How to perform accessibility audits and optimize image alt text.

## Next Steps
In the future, I plan to add interactivity with JavaScript features such as a light/dark-mode switch and a project-gallery filter.  
I’d also like to explore modern frameworks like React or Vue to expand this portfolio into a dynamic web application that can include blogs or project updates.
