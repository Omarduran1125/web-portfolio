1. Best Feature:
The portfolio has a clean, modern design with excellent use of images and responsive layout. 
I liked how he added the extra hover Features making more enjoyable as a user.. 
The “About Me” section shows a strong passion for information systems and technology, and the skill list gives a good snapshot of his technical foundation

2. Suggested Improvement:
A approvement that I might suggest is adding lighter colors to make it more pleasant on the user's eyes instead of using really bold colors
